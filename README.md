# ImpressiveAI
Impressive Machines's C++ Library for Machine Learning and Computer Vision

## Dependencies
In order to use the library, you will need the boost libraries from http://boost.org.


##

The convention in this library is that all the out parameters of a function come first on the argument list.


## Core

* Flexible light-weight matrix view template which references one or two dimensional pre-existing memory arrays with arbitrary row and column strides, and allows for passing matrix data by reference and for constant time data re-formatting enabling common operations such as transpose, subviews, or decimation.

* Core set of BLAS-style matrix operations using matrix views as arguments.

* Dynamically-sized reference counted matrix class with overloaded operators that implements typical matrix operations.
